    "This jupyter notebook <b>Calc_VectorAndTensorField_Iteration</b> calculates the local diffusion tensors and directed motion vectors, including the following steps:\n",
    "- single-molecule trajectories are fed in\n",
    "- unit transformation to a nanometre scale\n",
    "- trajectories are filtered to meet a minimum step length for the furhter analysis\n",
    "- single localisations are excluded (important for the evaluation of simulations)\n",
    "- padding of feature spaces for later binning\n",
    "- calculation of the local diffusion tensors and directed motion vectors Â± consideration of static and dynamic localisation errors.\n",

    "Consideration of the localisation errors can be modulated by the input parameter 'errcorr'.\n",
