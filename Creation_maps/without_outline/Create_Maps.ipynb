    "The jupyter notebook <b>Create_Maps</b> creates the diffusion and direted motion maps without outlining a structural element. The maps show the local information on diffusion and directed motion. The localisation error in the directed motion is taken into account here. The calculation is defined by the input parameter 'errcorr'. \n",

    "The diffusion map is an ellipse plot. The eigenvalues (diffusion coefficients) and eigenvectors (orientation of the ellipses) are calculated from the local diffusion tensors. Additionally, the eigenvalues are used to calculate the eccentricity of the ellipses. Finally, the plots (.pdf,.png) and information on the diffusion coeffcients, angle as well as the eccentricity are saved to the result folder of the diffusion maps. \n",
