This is a short manual for the Python scripts:

- outline_marker_signal.py
- Highlighting_fp.py



outline_marker_signal.py:

This script extracts the outline from single-molecule localisation of a structural element. Following steps are executed:
1. Unit transformation to a nanometre scale
2. Padding by the same number of subpixels used for the trajectory analysis
3. Adjustment of the feature space to the feature space of the trajectory analysis
4. Removal of background signal by a polygon line (query via a pup-up window)
5. Specifying the number of structural elements by a pop-up window
6. Selection of the structural elects by a polygon line
7. Generation of the outline by a concave hull
8. Scaling of the coordinates by the binning factor (trajectory analysis)
9. Saving of outline coordinates at nanometre scale and after application of the scaling factor

Requirements for the input matrix (.mat): x and y coordinates have to be located in the 3rd and 4th column.


Highlighting_fp.py: (OPTIONAL) --> uses the raw coordinates (output from outline_marker_signal.py) which are NOT scaled by the binning factor

1. Script ascertained number of structural elements automatically by the structure input data
2. Selection of the part to be highlighted by a polygon line
3. Result will be plotted in a window which vanishes after 10 seconds
4. Scaling of the coordinates by the binning factor (trajectory analysis)
5. Saving the coordinates of the highlighted part
